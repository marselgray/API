# API

This repo demonstrates a RESTful API.
The schema returns stock symbol, HQ location, and futures as string data;
open, close, high, and low as number data, and whether it is a bull market as boolean. 


Languages used include Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Node-Restful, and Nodemon.


If cloning down you will need to run npm install and then nodemon to run the server. Local host 3000.
